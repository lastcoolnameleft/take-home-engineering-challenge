# Developer Notes

## Requirements

* PHP 7+

## Design considerations

PHP was chosen for this exercise because I had already utilized and tested a lat/long to distance function 10 years ago which I have been relying upon for https://www.duckiehunt.com.  This helped reduce development time.

While not as "sexy" as Python, Node, etc. it is the 5th most popular language by Github PR's (See: https://octoverse.github.com/) and still has a strong community.
